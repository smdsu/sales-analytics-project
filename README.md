# Sales Analytics Project README Guide

## Overview

Welcome to the Sales Analytics Project! This project is designed to provide comprehensive analytics and reporting on sales data to empower business decisions. It leverages modern technologies to process, analyze, and visualize sales information in a user-friendly manner.

## Technologies
- Python 3.11
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- Alembic
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Pytest â€” for testing

## Features

- **CRUD operations:** 
The API provides full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) capabilities for managing customers, products, and sales data. This allows users to maintain an up-to-date database that reflects all changes in real-time.
- **Data caching with Redis:** 
To enhance performance and reduce database load, the API implements caching mechanisms using Redis. This feature accelerates data retrieval processes and ensures that frequent queries deliver swift responses without repeatedly hitting the database.
- **Importing and Exporting data to CSV files:** 
This functionality allows users to export data into CSV format for external analysis or reporting and import data from CSV files into the system. This feature is particularly useful for bulk data migration or backup and data analysis in tools that require CSV input.
- **Search and filtering by parameters:** 
The API supports advanced search and filtering options, enabling users to retrieve data based on specific parameters. This feature is crucial for generating targeted reports or finding specific information quickly, without needing to manually sift through extensive datasets.
- **Batch operations and automation:** 
Batch processing capabilities are included to handle operations on large datasets efficiently. This feature allows for the automation of tasks such as updating records in bulk or processing large numbers of transactions simultaneously, which is essential for maintaining large-scale data integrity and timely data management.

   ```

2. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

### Accessing the API

You can interact with the API through any HTTP client or by using tools like Postman or Swagger. The API documentation is auto-generated and available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Example Requests

To fetch sales data:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/sales" -H  "accept: application/json"
```

To add a new sale:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/sales" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"item\":\"Product 1\",\"quantity\":2,\"price\":9.99}"
```

# Architecture Overview

The project is structured as a multi-module FastAPI application primarily designed to handle sales data management and analytics. It provides a RESTful API to interact with various resources like products, sales, customers, and users. The system is backed by a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage and Redis for caching.

## High-Level Structure

The application is divided into several key components:

1. **API Routers**:
   - Define the HTTP endpoints and handle the web requests.
   - Routers are organized by domain logic (e.g., products, sales, customers).

2. **Database Models**:
   - Represent the database schema using SQLAlchemy ORM.
   - Models for each domain entity (e.g., Product, Sale, Customer).

3. **Data Access Objects (DAO)**:
   - Encapsulate the database access logic.
   - Provide a higher-level interface to query and manipulate data in the database.

4. **Business Logic**:
   - Contained within service layers or directly in route handlers, depending on complexity.
   - Includes authentication, authorization, and complex data manipulations.

5. **Schemas (Pydantic Models)**:
   - Define the structure of request and response data.
   - Used for data validation and serialization/deserialization.

6. **Utilities**:
   - Helper functions and common tools used across the application (e.g., password hashing, token management).

7. **Migrations**:
   - Manage database schema changes using Alembic.
   - Ensures the database schema is version controlled and sync with the ORM models.

## Key Modules and Files

### API Routers

- `app/main.py`: Entry point for the FastAPI application. Includes route definitions and exception handlers.
- `app/products/router.py`, `app/sales/router.py`, etc.: Define routes specific to each domain area.

### Database Models

- `app/database.py`: Configuration for the SQLAlchemy database connection and session.
- `app/products/models.py`, `app/sales/models.py`, etc.: SQLAlchemy models representing database tables.

### Data Access Objects

- `app/dao/base.py`: Base class for all DAOs providing common operations like find, add, update, and delete.
- `app/products/dao.py`, `app/sales/dao.py`, etc.: Specific DAOs extending the functionality of the base DAO as needed.

### Schemas

- `app/products/schemas.py`, `app/sales/schemas.py`, etc.: Pydantic models for data validation and serialization.

### Utilities

- `app/users/auth.py`: Authentication and authorization utilities, including JWT handling.
- `app/config.py`: Configuration management, loading settings from environment variables.

### Migrations

- `app/migration/env.py`: Alembic environment for migrations.
- `app/migration/versions/`: Directory containing individual migration scripts.

## Architectural Invariants

- **Layer Separation**: The architecture strictly separates the web layer (API routes), service layer (business logic), data access layer (DAOs), and data model layer (database models).
- **Dependency Direction**: Higher-level modules (like API routes) can depend on lower-level modules (like DAOs and models) but not vice versa.
- **Statelessness**: The API is designed to be stateless, where session state is managed client-side with JWTs, promoting scalability and reliability.

## Boundaries

- **External API Boundary**: Defined by the routes in `app/main.py` and other router modules, acting as the interface between the client applications and the server.
- **Database Boundary**: Managed through SQLAlchemy ORM models and sessions, abstracting the database interactions and ensuring the integrity of data transactions.

## Future Development Plans
- **Adding Analytical Queries:**
We plan to introduce advanced analytical queries to provide deeper insights into sales data. This includes generating reports for top-selling products, revenue analysis, and other business-critical metrics. These analytical features will help users better understand market trends and make data-driven decisions.

- **Implementing OAuth2 Authentication**
To enhance security and provide better control over who accesses the API, we aim to implement OAuth2 authentication. This will ensure that API transactions are secure and that clients can safely access their data. OAuth2 provides a robust framework for managing authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can perform operations.

- **Integrating Logging and Monitoring**
Logging and monitoring are crucial for maintaining the reliability and stability of the API. We plan to integrate comprehensive logging mechanisms to capture detailed information about API usage, errors, and system performance. Additionally, monitoring will be set up to track the health of the API and provide alerts for any potential issues, ensuring high availability and prompt troubleshooting.

- **Periodic Redis Cache Purging**
To maintain cache efficiency and ensure that the data remains current, we will implement periodic purging of the Redis cache. This will help in managing cache size, improving cache hit rates, and ensuring that outdated information is removed in a timely manner. This is essential for systems where data integrity and freshness are critical.
